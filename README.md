# seo_challenge

To complete this challenge, please study the two files in the "example_files" directory. One of these files is named
"arrays_original_file.md" - this file is the original, non-edited version. The other file in that directory is named
"arrays_updated_file.md" - this file has been updated and SEO optimized. It's actually not yet complete - but a good
first draft of optimization has been completed. In the "challenge_files" directory you will find one "original" (unedited)
file named "json_primer_original.md" - your task is to rewrite this content into the "json_primer_updated.md" file. The 
content you write must be in Markdown format. 

I will email you a link to some documentation and notes that Ryan has taken during our calls. I encourage you to read them.
If you cannot access the notes, please let me know as soon as possible. 

Please do not ask Ryan H. for assistance with this challenge. 

I encourage you to use Visual Studio code for this project. It has nice markdown tools and a markdown file "preview" option
which is nice.
